# HeuCov
HeuCov is a heuristic method for location allocation of broadcast stations in a single frequency network (SFN). 
The method uses Terrain data (without cartographic projection) for finding good locations for multiple broadcast stations.
The stations are condidered to have the same EIRP and of height above soil.   
Coverage is modeled using the ITU P.1546-1 propagation model for the optimization.
